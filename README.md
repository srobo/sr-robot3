`sr-robot` - Python 3 API for Student Robotics Kit

This is the API for Student Robotics, library for writing Robotics APIs.
It will first be deployed at Student Robotics 2024.

## Installation

If you wish to install openCV from your package manager, you can install the base package with:

```bash
pip install sr-robot
```

To install the full package, including openCV, you can install with:

```bash
pip install sr-robot[vision]
```

## Usage

The main entry point for the API is the `Robot` class.
Intantiating this class will automatically detect and connect to any SR v4 boards connected to the device.
By default, the `Robot` class will wait for the start button on the power board to be pressed before continuing.

```python

from sr.robot import Robot

r = Robot()

```

To disable the waiting for the start button, you can pass `wait_for_start=False` to the constructor.
The `wait_for_start` method needs to be called before the metadata is available.

```python

from sr.robot import Robot

r = Robot(wait_for_start=False)

# Setup in here

r.wait_start()

```

## Developer Notes

There are a number of considerations that have been made in the design of this API.
Some of these may not be immediately obvious, so they are documented below.

- The API is designed to raise exceptions for incorrect actions, such as trying to modify the output dictionary or assign a value directly to the motor object.
- `MappingProxyType` is used to prevent the user from adding, removing or overwriting keys in any parts of the API that return a dictionary.
- `tuple` is used to prevent the user from adding, removing or overwriting items in any parts of the API that would return a list.
- `__slots__` is used to prevent the user from adding, removing or overwriting attributes in any parts of the API.
- `sr.robot.serial_wrapper.SerialWrapper` handles automatic reconnection to the serial port if the connection is lost and impleents 3 retries on any serial operation before raising a `BoardDisconnectionError`.
